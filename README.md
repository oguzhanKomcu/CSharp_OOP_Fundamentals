 
 ## OOP (OBJECT ORİENTED PROGRAMİNG)
 
 OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) is supported by many programming languages today.It is a programming technique that shortens software development processes, makes them systematic and regular.It simplifies the maintenance, modification, and debugging of code.Develops software with an object-oriented approach.C# is a programming language that uses this programmatic approach.
 
 ## CLASS
 The object phenomenon in OOP is almost the same as in everyday life.Objects consist of a main class and are separated according to their properties.For example, a bicycle is an object. It has certain properties. By defining these properties in a bike class, we can produce many bike objects.In C#, we actually work with many embedded classes. For example, Random, button , Texbox etc.You can learn about the example and operation of the Oop "class" topic here.
